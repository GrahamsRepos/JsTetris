# Typescript Tetris

Two implementations of the same Tetris logic using Typescript:
1) An HTML based Tetris (App.ts , Index.html) -- In progress
2) My Favorite -> A Commandline Tetris (ConsoleTetris.ts) -- Nearly done

## Requirements
#### Commandline Tetris Version:
* Nodejs, tested on version > 10.0.0 , see https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm for easy node version management
* Install dependencies by running **npm install** 
* The entrypoint for the commandline version is in the ./game folder, to play run
